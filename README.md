# fft-image-viusalization

This is the project for viusalize the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on image. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is also implemented by utilizing multiple workers threads, and, obviously, it's much slower than FFT, thus being not showed in demo.

The demo is here: https://pureblackkk.github.io/fft-image-visualization/

You can **upload image** and test different **filters**. Examples are shown in below.
