# fft-image-visualization

This is the project for visualize the fast Fourier transform (FFT) on image. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is also implemented by utilizing multiple workers threads, and, obviously, it's much slower than FFT, thus not being showed in demo.

The demo is here: https://pureblackkk.github.io/fft-image-visualization/

You can **upload image** and test different **filters**. Examples are shown in below.

Note that the image uploaded is croped to fit the FFT method and scaled for display, leading to some deviation to a certain extent.
